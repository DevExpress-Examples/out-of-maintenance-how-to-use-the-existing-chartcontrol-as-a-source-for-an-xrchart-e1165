# How to use the existing ChartControl as a source for an XRChart


<p>This example demonstrates how you can use existing <strong>ChartControls</strong> as a source for <strong>XRCharts</strong> (an <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#XtraReports/CustomDocument2162">XtraReports</a> control). This may be useful, e.g. when it is needed to print several ChartControls simultaneously.</p><p>For this, place four empty XRChart controls onto a report's surface, and adjust their size and position as you need. Then, you can use the existing ChartControl instances as a source for these XRChart controls.</p>
